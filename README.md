# 🏆 Multiplayer Typing Test Platform

A real-time **multiplayer typing practice platform** designed for students, professionals, and competitive exam aspirants. The platform makes typing practice **engaging, competitive, and fun** by allowing users to **race with others** or practice individually with analytics and achievements.

---

## 📌 Problem Statement

Traditional typing practice tools focus only on solo practice and lack the **excitement of real-time competition**.
This project solves that by providing:

* Multiplayer races with friends/strangers.
* Live leaderboards with WPM and accuracy.
* Gamified progress tracking and achievements.

---

## 🚀 Features

### ✅ Multiplayer Mode

* Create/join rooms and compete in real-time typing races.
* Live scoreboard showing **WPM & accuracy** of all players.
* Countdown timer and synchronized race start.

### ✅ Single Player Mode

* Daily typing challenges.
* Accuracy, speed, and error analysis.
* Track historical performance.

### ✅ User System

* Login / Register (JWT authentication).
* Personal profile with typing stats.
* Achievements and progress tracking.

### ✅ Leaderboard & Analytics

* Global & friends leaderboard.
* Player stats (WPM trends, accuracy, best streaks).

### ✅ Gamification

* Animated typing races (Phaser.js).
* Progress bars, confetti, and badges.
* Motivating sound & visual effects.
